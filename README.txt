// DESCRIPTION
This bionics mod adds 23 new cyberbrains from the world of Ghost in the Shell! These are advanced changes to the brain where micromachines graft microcircuitry to organic tissue, and creates a hybrid of the original brain tissue with cybernetic components. The end result is superior to the original in everyway- and will boost the user's mental capabilities greatly. Additionally, cyberbrains will allow the user to dampen felt pain and obtain specialized work or combat bonuses by accessing net databases. Some specialized cyberbrains are even able to establish a combat network, providing combat buffs for anyone in range.

Of course, there are varying levels to how far we can go, with increased rewards and drawbacks depending on how far you go through the cyberization process. A colonist with minimal cyberization will see some benefits, but nothing near someone with extreme cyberization. At the same time, the colonist with minimal cyberization is the least likely to suffer from changes to their mental state as well as risks of cyberbrain diseases.

As this mod mainly adds brain cyberware, I've made sure to add support and encourage the usage of another bionics mod such as EPOE-Forked with this one. I have tried to balance around these mods the best I can, and also added various patches to increase integration between this and others!

// WHAT'S INSIDE

This mod adds a new research tree, a new resource with multiple applications, 8 cyberbrain abilities giving various buffs, two cyberbrain diseases and of course 23 new cyberbrains!

Cyberbrains primarily provide bonuses to consciousness, manipulation, research speed and learning speed for all. Many however will specialize into a variety of niches and provide bonuses/abilities for said niche, from cooking to brutal melee combat.

To make a cyberbrain, you will need to research the appropriate projects in the GiTS research tree first. After this, you will be able to produce micromachines at a fabrication table along with cyberbrains- which require micromachines to be produced. Once completed, all that is required is a surgery to install the cyberbrain. Such advanced neurotechnology requires at least a decent skillset, so make sure your colonists have passable medicine and crafting!

Cyberbrains come in the following forms:

Basic Cyberbrain
This is the most basic cyberization process which leaves a majority of the brain intact, therefore having almost no drawbacks. Once installed, the user will see minor bonuses to consciousness, manipulation, and learning speed. They will also be able to access the net, allowing the user to receive work speed bonuses for some time. After installation, users will only take about a day to adapt to the cyberbrain.

Enhanced Cyberbrain
At this stage, only about 20% of the human brain is left. This is a general upgrade over a basic cyberbrain, and sees exponentially higher bonuses. At this point however, drawbacks begin to appear. Users will take about two days to adapt to cyberbrains now, and during this time have a slight (less than 1%) chance of contracting a cyberbrain disease. Additionally, the mind begins to display heightened emotions, leading to mental state drawbacks.

Specialized Cyberbrains (8 combat bonused, 11 work bonused)
This mod has 19 total of these cyberbrains, and are similar to the enhanced cyberbrain but with unique bonuses and abilities for certain niches in both work and combat. Most colonists will find this type of cyberbrain to be the ones they will aim for as risks and drawbacks are quite managable at this stage, and additional 'advanced' variants exist to push the strengths of some of these even further.

Extreme Cyberbrains (1 combat bonused, 1 work bonused)
This is about as far as cyberization can go, with this mod featuring two of these cyberbrains which replace up to 97.5% of the human brain. Cyberization at this level is a decision that should be weighed before doing so, and will be extremely beneficial to those that can take it- and harmful to those that cannot. The abilities and bonuses of these cyberbrains are unmatched by any other, but at great cost. Users will still only require two days to adapt, but with a slight increased risk of cyberbrain diseases.

Cyberbrain Diseases
As mentioned above, during the adaptation phase of cyberization a colonist may contract a cyberbrain disease. This mod features two, Cyberbrain Sclerosis and Closed Shell Syndrome.

Cyberbrain sclerosis is an extremely rare cyberbrain disease where the afflicted's brain tissue begins to harden. This will result in memory loss overtime, talking inhibition and eventually after 30 days: brain death. There is no practical cure for this disease which means you may have to use mech serums, so be careful!

Closed Shell Syndrome is a rare cyberbrain disease where a user will shut themselves off from others. This can be compared to trauma savant in Rimworld, with those afflicted becoming savants in computing and other niches that may prove useful. It is not fatal.

Micromachine Treatments
Micromachines are not just for cyberization and can be used to treat some conditions! Nanites can be administered to colonists to boost their immunity in order to combat diseases. Additionally, nanites can be programmed to combat food poisoning, toxin buildup and even organ decay!

// COMBAT EXTENDED
This mod will self-patch when loaded after Combat Extended and will take advantage of stats added by it. Balancing changes have been made for all cyberbrains affected due to CE's increased damage, but feedback is always accepted on further balance changes in the comments.

// COMPATIBILITY
- Should be safe to add to save games and work with most if not all bionics mods such as MSE2. It is never safe to remove a mod from a save, but removing this mod should not cause significant issues.
- All cyberbrains will take advantage of Elite Bionics Framework if it is loaded, and have three levels of durability based on the cyberbrain type: thin metal shell, metal shell and advanced metal shell.
- Includes support for AUTOMATIC's Bionic Icons mod.
- Contains patches to add workbench and/or research tree patches for EPOE-Forked, FSF Advanced Bionics Expansion, RBSE, RBSE Hardcore and Eccentric Tech Core.

// CHANGELOG
1.0.3 // 11-07-2024
General Changes:
- Added learning helper tutorials based on feedback. These skip lore unlike other descriptions and primary focus on usage in a simplified format.
- Further comments added throughout XML to add clarity to certain sections.
- Updated melee damage factor values in CE patches.
- Updated Manifest.xml with additional load rules for Combat Extended, only relevant to users on 1.4 using old third party mod managers.
- Changes to README.txt adding separate licenses for the mod and art assets.

Balance Changes:
- Lowered research project cost of central nervous cyberization, cyberbrain interfaces and the net by 200 each.
- Extreme cyberization research project cost raised (1500 -> 2500).
- Closed Shell Syndrome rebalanced, focusing less on manipulation and more on learning/hacking ability; Manipulation gain lowered (25% -> 8%), hacking speed gain raised (200% -> 250%), global learning speed raised (50% -> 65%) and meditation focus gain raised (100% -> 150%).

Fixes:
- Fixed Cyberbrain Sclerosis sometimes not progressing if certain disease overhaul mods are also loaded.
- Fixed incorrect description of Cyberbrain Sclerosis.

- Pain Dampen ability now sets pain factor to 25% (was 20%).
- Basic cyberbrain now has access to Pain Dampen ability.
- Extreme cyberization now requires 3 days to adapt (previously 2).
